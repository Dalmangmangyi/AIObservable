# AIObservable

AIObservable is an implementation of the observer pattern in Objective-C. It handles a set of observers and dispatches notifications, handling the case where observers are added or removed in the notification callback. For more information see the [blog post](http://a-coding.com/observer-pattern-in-objective-c/).


## Usage
Copy the source files to your project or add `pod 'AIObservable'` to your Podfile.
